# AWS Single Sign\-On quotas<a name="limits"></a>

The following tables describe quotas within AWS SSO\. 

## Application quotas<a name="applicationlimits"></a>

**Note**  
[Permission sets](permissionsetsconcept.md) are provisioned in AWS accounts as IAM roles and therefore follow IAM quotas\. For more information about quotas that are associated with IAM roles, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html)\.

|  Number of unique directory groups that can be assigned \*  | 2500 | Yes | 
|  Number of connected directories that you can have at a time  | 1 | No | 

\* Users can belong to many directory groups, and a directory may contain many groups \(see [AWS SSO identity store quotas](#ssodirectorylimits)\)\. Within AWS SSO, a maximum of 2500 of these groups can be assigned for using accounts and applications\.

## AWS SSO identity store quotas<a name="ssodirectorylimits"></a>

## AWS SSO throttle limits<a name="ssothrottlelimits"></a>


| Resource | Default quota | 
| --- | --- | 
| AWS SSO APIs | All [AWS SSO APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) have a throttle limit maximum of 20 transactions per second \(TPS\)\. The [CreateAccountAssignment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAccountAssignment.html) has a maximum rate of 10 outstanding async calls\. These quotas cannot be changed\. |

\* Only 500 AWS accounts or applications \(total combined\) are supported\. For example, you might configure 275 accounts and 225 applications, resulting in a total of 500 accounts and applications\.

\*\* Before displaying the user’s available AWS accounts and application icons in the user portal, AWS SSO evaluates the user’s effective permissions by evaluating their group memberships\. Only 1000 unique groups can be used to determine a user’s effective permissions\.
